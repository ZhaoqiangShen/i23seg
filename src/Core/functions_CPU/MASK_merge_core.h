/* A method to ensure connectivity within regions of the segmented image/volume. Here we assume
 * that the MASK has been obtained using some classification/segmentation method such as k-means or gaussian
 * mixture. Some pixels/voxels have been misclassified and we check the spatial dependences
 * and correct the mask. We check the connectivity using the bresenham line algorithm within the non-local window
 * surrounding the pixel of interest.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 * 1. MASK [0:255], the result of some classification algorithm (information-based preferably)
 * 2. The list of classes (e.g. [3,4]) to apply the method. The given order matters.
 * 3. The total number of classes in the MASK.
 * 4. The size of the Correction Window inside which the method works.

 * Output:
 * 1. MASK_upd - the UPDATED MASK where some regions have been corrected (merged) or removed
 * 2. CORRECTEDRegions - The array of the same size as MASK where all regions which were
 * changed are highlighted and the changes have been counted
